## Legionella Vulnerability App

This is a data visualization application built for the Water Research Foundation to predict presence of the Legionella bacteria in water distribution systems. 

Users can upload their utility's water quality sample site data as well as their distribution system asset locations. The web app utilizes a scoring equation to assign Legionella vulnerability scores to each water quality sample based on specific analytes.
